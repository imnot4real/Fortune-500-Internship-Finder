# Fortune-500-Internship-Finder
A Python app that extracts the Fortune 500 list from a CSV, searches for their careers pages via Google, scrapes these pages for internship opportunities, and displays the results in a Tkinter-based desktop interface. Requires requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, googlesearch-python, and tkinter.

Run new1.py to get the career pages of the companies. Run app2.py to search for internship results.
